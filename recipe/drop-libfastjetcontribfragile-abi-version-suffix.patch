Subject: [PATCH] fix: Drop ABI version suffix for libfastjetcontribfragile
 SONAME

* Use 'libfastjetcontribfragile.so' as the fastjetcontribfragile library
  shared object name (SONAME) to avoid runtime errors for loading shared
  libraries. This points to a potential issue with how
  libfastjetcontribfragile is built, but as 'fragile' is in the name, it
  is known to have issues in general.
